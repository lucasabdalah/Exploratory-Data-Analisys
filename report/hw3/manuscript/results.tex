\subsection{Training results}

During the training phase of all the models proposed, we applied the cross-validation 
with $k=10$ subgroups, allowing protection against overfitting. To verify the results
on the training set, we look at figure (2) and table (8). From the figure, we can 
conclude that non-linear methods, such as SVM and the Decision Trees with 100 nodes, 
have better performance when compared to simpler methods, such as Decision Trees with 10 
nodes and Linear Methods.

However, this pattern does not hold on the test set, since the linear models obtained 
a quite good generalization capacity, making them as efficient as the non-linear models.
